# Certifi

A decentralized application for verifying the integrity of academic records.

## 1. Introduction

Certifi is a blockchain-based system designed to enable educational institutions to issue, manage, and verify academic credentials in a trustless and decentralized manner. This document outlines the architecture, key components, and design decisions made during the development process.

## 2. Problem Statement

The core problem Certifi aims to solve is the verification and authentication of academic credentials while preventing fraud and reducing administrative overhead. Traditional systems face several challenges including document forgery, time-consuming verification processes, and lack of standardization across institutions.

### 2.1 Credential Verification Lifecycle

1. **Issue**: Institution creates a digital credential with student data and achievement records.
2. **Sign**: The credential is cryptographically signed by authorized institution representatives.
3. **Store**: The credential hash and metadata are stored on the blockchain.
4. **Share**: Students can share their credentials with verifiers.
5. **Verify**: Third parties can instantly verify the authenticity of credentials.

### 2.2 Potential Issues and Challenges

Roughly in order of priority:

- **Authentication**: Ensuring only authorized institutions can issue credentials.
  - **Strategy:** Multi-signature requirement and role-based access control for institutional accounts.
- **Revocation**: Handling cases where credentials need to be revoked or updated.
  - **Strategy:** Implement a revocation registry with timestamped entries.
- **Scalability**: Managing large numbers of credentials efficiently.
  - **Strategy:** Use content-addressable storage for detailed records with blockchain storing only hashes.
- **Interoperability**: Ensuring credentials can be recognized across different systems.
  - **Strategy:** Implement standardized formats (e.g., W3C Verifiable Credentials) and cross-chain bridges.
- **Cost**: Minimizing blockchain transaction costs for institutions.
  - **Strategy:** Batch credential issuance and use layer-2 solutions when appropriate.

## 3. High-level Features

- Issues verifiable academic credentials on the blockchain
- Supports multiple credential types (degrees, certificates, transcripts)
- Implements role-based access control for institutions
- Provides selective disclosure of credential information
- Enables instant verification by third parties
- Supports credential revocation and updates
